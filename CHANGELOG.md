#3.0.2 (2016-03--04):
 - Hotfix (#47): There was a bug that Builder has not been generated when Fragment have no (zero) arguments 
 
#3.0.1 (2015-12-28): 
 - Minor Bugfix (#35): when using custom `Bundler` and setter methods (because annotated field is private) java compiler could not determine the generic type of setter method parameter.
 
#3.0.0 (2015-11-02): See [this](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/fragmentargs3/) blog post for more information
 - You now have to annotate the Fragment class itself with `@FragmentWithArgs`. For backward compatibility reasons this is not mandatory. However it's strongly recommended because in further versions of FragmentArgs this could become mandatory to support more features. 
 - Deprecated `@FragmentArgsInherited`. Use `@FragmentWithArgs(inherited = true or false)` instead.
 - Support for setter methods: Still annotate your fields with `@Arg` not the setter method. Now you can annotate `private` fields as well, but you have to provide the corresponding setter method.
 - Kotlin support: Since setter methods are now supported, FragmentArgs support kotlin backing fields out of the box.
 - Generated Builder classes are now per default annotated with `@NonNull` from androids support annotation library. Furthermore, this adds even better kotlin support since kotlin uses this annotations for null safety. You can disable this option by using annotation processor option `fragmentArgsSupportAnnotations false`. See readme for detail information.
 - You can use annotation processor option `fragmentArgsBuilderAnnotations "com.example.MyAnnotation"` to annotate the generated builder classes with additional third party annotations. See readme for details information.

#2.1.0 (2015-05-01)
 - Added `ArgsBundler` to provide a plugin mechanism for not out of the box supported data types. Two ArgsBundler are already provided `CastedArrayListArgsBundler` and `PacelerArgsBundler`.
 - Removed warning: "Could not load the generated automapping class. However, that may be ok, if you use FragmentArgs in library projects".
 - Better error messages if annotating `@Arg` on unsupported type fields.

#2.0.1 (2014-12-22)
